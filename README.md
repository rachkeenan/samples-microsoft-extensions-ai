# Microsoft.Extensions.AI samples
I am going to work through the features of the new Microsoft.Extensions.AI library

## Installation
1. Clone the repository

## Prerequisites
- LLM api key and model (I used OpenAI)

## Embeddings
This feature contains two basic console app samples

*Sample 1:* Uses OpenAI's embedding model to generate vectors and displays them in the console

*Sample 2:* Generates embeddings and then queries the embeddings, returning the top 3 results in similarity
